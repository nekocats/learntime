# Project goal
Nowadays many kids do not know how to tell time correctly when they start first grade of school. They will miss their buses after school or they do not know when to return to class after lunchtime is over. It causes unwanted problems and stress to students and especially their parents. The aim of this project is to teach children how to tell time on a playful and fun way so they can use this knowledge in real life and manage their own time correctly.

Communication with teammate.
Learned a little html, css (I made circles for hours/minutes and added pointers) and try to understand little bit git js.
It was my first project where I attended so I can basically take everything from here :slightly_smiling_face:

The main soft skill I learned was of course teamwork and how to communicate within my team and it is no shame in asking fr help and guidnce from the more knowledgeable ones. A hard skill I learned was how to create a readme file (:D) and I got more familiar with GitHub aswell. I didn`t learn any specific coding per se, but I saw how the overall process is done and how different languages are put together and how our groups masterminds were working in their own element. In the next project I am already familiar with the overall process and how important it is to first put a plan together and do a wireframe first.
